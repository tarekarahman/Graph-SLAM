# Graph-SLAM

Here is GRAPH SLAM code and an online version of it where I developed based on the attached paper by Stanford CS Professor Sebastian Thrun. It was provided as skeleton code based on his AI Stanford course and I filled it out.  It uses simulated data as input. The Full Graph SLAM-retains entire path (poses) and all landmarks. The Online SLAM version of it - retains all landmarks but only most recent robot/vehicle pose and reduces the dimensionality of the estimation problem from M+N dimensions to M+1, where M and N are the number of landmarks and ego-vehicle poses respectively .
